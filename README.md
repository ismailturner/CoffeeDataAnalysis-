<h1>Coffee Sales Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In my Coffee Sales Data Analysis project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis using advanced Excel functions, including XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, and multiple IF functions, to efficiently retrieve and calculate data. I developed a formula to accurately compute total sales, enhanced data clarity with proper formatting, and created pivot tables and charts to summarize key metrics. To streamline analysis and support business decision-making, I built an interactive dashboard featuring dynamic filters to visualize sales trends, top customers, and coffee preferences.
